# Online Examination System

## Overview

I developed a comprehensive **Online Examination System** using **C#**, **ASP.NET**, and **SQL Server**, designed to digitize and streamline the assessment process for educational institutions. The platform enables teachers to create and manage multiple-choice and theory-based exams effortlessly, while students can register, participate in exams, and instantly view their results.

Key features include automated grading for objective questions, a dynamic leaderboard to encourage competition, and a user-friendly interface tailored for both educators and learners.

This project enhanced my skills in full-stack web development, including front-end and back-end integration, database design and management, and implementing secure user authentication. It demonstrates my ability to build scalable, efficient, and transparent digital solutions that improve operational workflows, reduce paper usage, and deliver accurate, real-time results - valuable expertise for modern education and corporate training environments.
